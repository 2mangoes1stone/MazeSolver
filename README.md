# MazeSolver

## A simple program to solve a given maze

### Written in TypeScript because TypeScript is awesome ðŸ¤“

This program is already compiled to JS to run in the browser. Simple clone this repo and run `maze.html` on your browser to view the solution.

To view the code, please open the `main.ts` file as `main.js` is the compiled version and might read like prehistoric code  ðŸ¤”
